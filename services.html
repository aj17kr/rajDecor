        <h3>2. False Ceiling</h3>
        <p>False Ceiling is the ceiling made beneath the main ceiling. There are so many materials used in false ceiling like wood, gypsum, thermocol, PVC etc. Nowadays PVC is trending material used for false ceiling.</p>
        <p>There are many advantages of false ceiling that why one should opt this.</p> 
        <p><strong>Advantages:-</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>It has the same advantage as that of the first advantage of POP i.e. a great life.</li>
          <li>False ceiling helps to make the room cool.</li>
          <li>It reduces the roof height so the room coolers like AC have to cover the less area of ceiling which is the main reason that how the false ceiling helps to make the room cool.</li>
          <li>As the materials used in false ceiling are a good insulators of fire, so it is fire resistant too.</li>
          <li>The main benefit of false ceiling is that it acts as a base for decorative lights, chandeliers and fans.</li>
          <li>It reduces the echo of a room.</li>
          <li>The maintenance cost of PVC false ceiling is almost zero</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>PVC False Ceiling</h3>
            <p>It was used as a decorative interior wall finish and had unique properties compared to other wall cladding at the time. PVC panels usually have a hollow core and are lightweight with a smooth surface for decoration and a tongue-and-groove system for easy installation.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantages:-</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>PVC is more durable than POP.</li>
              <li>PVC is more water resistant than POP.</li>
              <li>PVC false ceiling makes the room cool.</li>
              <li>PVC has more “Show Off” properties as compared to POP</li>
              <li>Decorative lights have a great impact in PVC than in POP.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Disadvantages:-</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The main disadvantage of opting PVC false ceiling is that it reduces the headroom.</li>
              <li>The material used is chlorine which is very dangerous in its natural state.</li>
              <li>If they are not maintained well i.e. if regular cleaning is not there, PVC false ceiling can be home for many spiders and other insects.</li>
              <li>False ceiling need the actual roof to be a bit high so that after the installation of this false ceiling, the room should not look smaller or compressed.</li>
              <li>They are not so solid so if something heavy is hanged with the ceiling, it can damage the ceiling as well as the object.</li>

              <h3>POP False Ceiling</h3>
              <p>POP is available in the powdered form and is mixed with water on site. This mixture is applied on a chicken mesh, which offers mechanical strength, and is then attached to a metal frame system. POP can be moulded into any shape in its hydrated form, as it dries, it hardens and retains the set shap.</p>
              <p><strong>Advantages:-</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>POP is a highly durable material. Since the same material is used for filling joints, it does not show cracks easily.</li>
                <li>Unlike gypsum board, plaster of paris offers great flexibility in designs and can be moulded into different curved shapes. Also, POP is ideal for designing cornices or creating an etched effect, as in this image.</li>
                <li>It mixes with water to form a mixture that is easy to spread and level. Additionally, POP has good adhesion qualities that create a smooth surface for paint colours to settle.</li>
                <li>It is cheaper than gypsum board.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Disadvantages:-</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>The process of mixing the contents of a POP false ceiling on site is a messy and lengthy process that requires lot of cleaning up afterwards.</li>
                <li>One major concern in using a POP mixture is that a lot of material is wasted during the application process and it requires adequate drying time.</li>
                <li>Unless the mixture is prepared correctly in the right proportions of POP and water, it will be of inferior quality, and might shrink or crack. For long-term durability make sure that only skilled workers mix and prepare the POP mixture at site.</li>
                <li>The ceiling cannot be installed when the POP surface is moist. The problem specially occurs during the monsoon season. You must allow the POP to dry completely before installation.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </div>

              <h3>Gypsum False Ceiling</h3>
              <p>Gypsum boards or panels come in a prefabricated ready-to-install form. They are fixed with screws to a metal frame that is attached to the ceiling slab or soffit (the underside of a structure). For long-term durability make sure that you opt for only good quality metal frames that are rust-proof.</p>
              <p><strong>Advantages:-</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>The biggest advantage of going for a gypsum ceiling is that it is a quick and clean method of installation that generates less dust during execution.</li>
                <li>Gypsum plaster boards are large, hence there are very few joints created during installation. These joints are finished with a jointing compound that dries very quickly.</li>
                <li>Gypsum boards are easy to work with and paint because of their smooth factory-produced finish.</li>
                <li>Since the mixture is made with precision in factory conditions, the quality remains consistent in boards of good brands.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Disadvantages:-</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>In case of any repairs, the ceiling needs to be broken down.</li>
                <li>The joints of the gypsum boards may show signs of cracks with the passage of time. Cracks may also be caused by slightest movement in the false ceiling due to ceiling repair, cutting of holes for light or fan fixtures or where the ceiling meets the adjoining walls.</li>
                <li>If moisture seeps into the gypsum ceiling through leaking roofs or air conditioning drain pipes, it may result in fungal growth or cause warping. As a precaution, opt for only good brands of gypsum board like India Gypsum, which allow minimum water retention.</li>

              <h3>Wooden False Ceiling</h3>
              <p>Wood false ceilings, wooden ceilings and wall coverings, is specially designed for enclosed spaces in which aesthetics and acoustic conditioning are earmarked as their best attributes.The wood has a place of honour between warm materials which are used to cover ceilings and walls. The warmth of this material becomes in optimum to big spaces, where a large number of people is gathered. In this way, it manages to exploit wood up to its most technical capacity, in places including public venues, offices, theatres, auditoriums, hospitals.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Advantages:-</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Wood is an insulator; keeps the room warm.</li>
                <li>Use a light coloured wood make the room look higher.</li>
                <li>Again using a light coloured wood introduces more light in to the room, but also make it “feel warmer”.</li>
                <li>Easy to maintain and does not create as much dust (providing it doesn't have a room above it where people walk).</li>
                <li>Near zero maintenance. </li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Disadvantages:-</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>In the case of a fire, wood makes it (fire) spread faster, and if upstairs encourages a roof fire, which is far more difficult to control.</li>
                <li>If too much damp, (steam from a kitchen say, or a house that is prone to condensation) and not well sealed or highly polished can start to rot, or peel away from the floor.</li>
                <li>Can be quite cold on bare feet as the wood, despite being a poor conductor, does remain pretty much the same temperature through out the year. However that can be dealt with by using “scatter rugs”.</li>
                <li>Is easily damaged by heavy weights, as well as scratching, making it look untidy. Can be “cured” by polishing but takes a later of the wood off.</li>

        <h3>3. Wall Design/Panels</h3>
        <p>A wall panel is single piece of material, usually flat and cut into a rectangular shape, that serves as the visible and exposed covering for a wall. Wall panels are functional as well as decorative, providing insulation and soundproofing, combined with uniformity of appearance, along with some measure of durability or ease of replaceability. </p>
        <p>Use of wall panels can reduce construction costs by providing a consistent appearance to the panelled surface without requiring the application of paint or another finishing material.</p>

              <p><strong>Advantages:-</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>POP is a highly durable material. Since the same material is used for filling joints, it does not show cracks easily.</li>
                <li>Unlike gypsum board, plaster of paris offers great flexibility in designs and can be moulded into different curved shapes. Also, POP is ideal for designing cornices or creating an etched effect, as in this image.</li>
                <li>It mixes with water to form a mixture that is easy to spread and level. Additionally, POP has good adhesion qualities that create a smooth surface for paint colours to settle.</li>
                <li>It is cheaper than gypsum board.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Disadvantages:-</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>The process of mixing the contents of a POP wall panel on site is a messy and lengthy process that requires lot of cleaning up afterwards.</li>
                <li>One major concern in using a POP mixture is that a lot of material is wasted during the application process and it requires adequate drying time.</li>
                <li>Unless the mixture is prepared correctly in the right proportions of POP and water, it will be of inferior quality, and might shrink or crack. For long-term durability make sure that only skilled workers mix and prepare the POP mixture at site.</li>
                <li>The panels cannot be installed when the POP surface is moist. The problem specially occurs during the monsoon season. You must allow the POP to dry completely before installation</li>

          <p>it is a material used in interior decoration to decorate the interior walls of domestic and public buildings. It is usually sold in rolls and is applied onto a wall using wallpaper paste. Wallpapers can come plain as "lining paper" (so that it can be painted or used to help cover uneven surfaces and minor wall defects thus giving a better surface), textured  with a regular repeating pattern design, or, much less commonly today, with a single non-repeating large design carried over a set of sheets. The smallest rectangle that can be tiled to form the whole pattern is known as the pattern repeat. </p>
